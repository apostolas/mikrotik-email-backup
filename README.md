# Mikrotik (RouterOS) email routers backup file.
RouterOS script in order to create router configuration backup send it to an gmail mail account.

1. First we have to resolve the smtp server of gmail. We can do this with the ping command from our host. (In our case the smtp.gmail.com host replied with 74.125.206.108).

2. Then check the configuration we make with the script commands in the mikrotik console. (check the txt file script.txt)
